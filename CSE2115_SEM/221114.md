## What is Software Engineering?
> There are three critical differences between programming and software engineering:
> - Time and Changes
> - Scale and Growth
> - Trade-offs and Cost

1. Time and Change
   - What is the life span of your code?
   - We aim to write sustainable code that can be easily changed and adapted over time
2. Scale and Growth
   - How many people are involved in the software?
     - Programming (Act of individual creation)
     - Software Engineering (team effort)
3. Trade-offs and Costs
   - There is no single solution that works in all contexts
   - We need to consider the different trade-offs

## Requirement engineering
> A requirement is a statement about one feature (or constraint) of the system we are going to develop

A requirement can be expressed in three main ways:
- Natural Language Requirements
- Model-based Requirements
  - Graphs (e.g. UML diagrams)
  -
