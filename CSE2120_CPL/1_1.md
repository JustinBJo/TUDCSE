# 1. Syntax
> The structure of program phrases in a language<br>
> A grammar describes the syntax of a language

## BNF Grammar
Backus-Naur form
- Metasyntax notation for context-free grammars
- used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets, etc

E ::= n
- E is the symbol, which is to be replaced by the expression n.
- n is the expression which is a (set of) symbols or other expressions.
- Different types of expressions are listed with | sign.
- Constants are expressed with "" sign.

Terminals and Non-terminals
- Symbols that never appear on the left side are terminals. (they cannot be expressed with other symbols)
- Symbols that appear on a left side are non-terminals.
- Example: hexadecimal with BNF
  - \<digit> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
  - \<letter> ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"
  - \<number> ::= \<digit> | \<letter>
  - \<integer> ::= \<number> | \<number>\<integer>


## Concrete Syntax (SDF)
The recipe for parsing and disambiguation<Br>

## Lexical syntax
The shape of the lexemes/words/tokens of a language<br>
Used to define the terminal symbols<br>

# 2. Abstract Syntax
> The abstract syntax of a program represents its structure and abstracts from irrelevant syntactic details

## Abstract Syntax Tree
An example of the abstract syntax tree:<br>
![img_3.png](images/img_3.png)

## Disambiguation
- Priorities
  - example) multiplication over addition
- Associativity (left, right, neither)
  - example) 1-(2-3) vs (1-2)-3
- By language design
  - example) brackets
- By grammar construction

An example of the process:<br>

# 3. Algebraic data types
"A type formed by combining other types"

## Inductive Definitions
Example of Natural numbers
- 0 is a natural number
- if n is a natural number, then n+1 is a natural number

Example of Integer lists
- `nil` is an integer list
- if x is an integer, and xs is an integer list, then x in front of xs is a list

Why use this? => PATTERN MATCHING!


# 4. Parsing
> Taking a concrete syntax and converting to an AST

![img_6.png](images/img_6.png)

- Parser Implementation strategies
  - Handwritten parser/parser combinators
    - parser combinations: combine simple parsers to make a new complex parser
  - Parser generator
    - feed a grammar and it generates the AST

## S-Expressions

Why do we use this?
- they are simple
- they are very easy to represent and manipulate inside a compiler

### S-Expressions Concrete Syntax

### S-Expression Parsing

Use case classes for this parsing procedure
