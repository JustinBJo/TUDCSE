# 230220_ Semantics and Transformations (2)

---

# 0. Overview
## So far...
- Parsing and pattern matching
- Semantics (the dynamic part)
  - Abstract syntax -> desugaring -> Core
- Interpretation vs Compilation
  - Interpreter: directly performs the actions in the high level program
  - Compiler: converts program to something executable by the program

## Learning Objectives
- Write interpreters for simple languages
- Explain differences, advantages, and disadvantages between compilers and interpreters
- Know which different types of sematics exist
- Explain what desugaring is, and why it is useful
- Implement a simple desugarer

# 1. Interpretation - Extending our language (with Conditionals)
Now we also need booleans on top of ints for the return values
- Encapsulate them with type "Value"

We can also do AND/OR operations with conditionals.
- We can make it short-circuiting
  - (or true x) still evaluates to true because it does not have to check the second element
  - (and false y) still evaluates to false with the same reason
  - This also means that (or false x) returns x (without type checking) and (and true y) returns y

# 2. Desugaring
We go from the abstract syntax to core by desugaring
> An elaboration of one program phrase into a different one<br>
> Typically, a desugaring reduces the number of syntactic forms in the core language


## Arithmetic desugaring
We can reduce subtraction and negation with plus, reducing the number of case classes

## Structural vs Generative Recursion
- Structural recursion
  - Recursive calls on a structural sub-expression of the input (reduce)
  - case UMinusExt(e) => desugar(MinusExt(0,a))
- Generative recursion
  - recursive calls on structures that the programmer generates (invent new AST nodes)
  - case UMinusExt(e) => MultC(-1, desugar(e))
- Structural recursion is generally preferable, because:
  - Structural recursion is guaranteed to terminate; generative is not
  - Structural recursion is a divide-and-conquer strategy
