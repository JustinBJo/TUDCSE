# 1. Vertices and Triangles

---
## 1. Simple triangles (GL_TRIANGLES)
```
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
glColor3f(1.0, 0.5, 0.0);
glVertex3f(-0.5, -0.5, 3.0);
glVertex3f(0.5, -0.5, 0.0);
glVertex3f(0.5, 0.5, -3.0);
glEnd();
```
We call glBegin with GL_TRIANGLES to start creating triangles. Note how we define the colour of the vertices first and then create vertices.<br>
OpenGL automatically creates triangles given 3 vertices.

## 2. Triangle strips (GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP)
```
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP);
glColor3f(1.0, 0.5, 0.0);
glVertex3f(-0.5, -0.5, 3.0);

glColor3f(0.0, 0.5, 1.0);
glVertex3f(0.5, -0.5, 0.0);
glVertex3f(0.5, 0.5, -3.0);

glColor3f(1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
glVertex3f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
glEnd();
```
The triangle strip is different from the simple triangle: when given the fourth point, triangle strip mode automatically creates new triangle with the second, third, and fourth vertices. The simple triangle mode creates triangle every on every third vertices.<br>

These triangles are transformed in a way that they are viewed on the screen by applying coordinate systems and matrix multiplications.
