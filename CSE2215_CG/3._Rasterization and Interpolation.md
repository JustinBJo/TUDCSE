# 3. Rasterization and Interpolation

---
## 1. Rasterization
Given the model on the screen(fragments), we need to colour the pixels. But how do we decide which pixel to fill?<br>
We can colour the pixels if the pixel centre is within the triangle. However, checking for all pixels is very expensive.<br>
We can use Axis-Aligned Bounding Box(AABB) and check for only the pixels that are inside the box.<br>

We can define the coordinates of the box by looking at the maximum and minimum x and y values. The coordinate of the box would be:<br>
(Xmin, Ymin), (Xmax, Ymin), (Xmin, Ymax), (Xmax, Ymax)

## 2. Interpolation
In our triangles, only the vertices have colours: we need to define colours(and other features) of any pixels that are inside the triangle too. We use interpolation for this.<br>

![barycentriccoordinates](images/barycentric.png)<br>
Area of the triangle using 3 vertices can be calculated as following:<br>
A(a,b,c) = (ax(by-cy) + bx(cy-ay) + cx(ay-by))/2

### Perspective correct interpolation
Models in 3D have an issue; even if a point p on a line lies in the middle, when viewed on 2D it might not be.<br>
The problem is that we do not know the depth of p during rasterization because p is not an input vertex. However, what we do know is the depth of the given vertices.<br>
