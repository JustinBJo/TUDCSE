# Turing Machine Definition

- Answer: Yes
- We do not need Îµ in the input alphabet

![img_1.png](../images/a2.png)

- Answer: D
- The size of the tape alphabet cannot be infinite

![img_2.png](../images/a3.png)

- Answer: C
- Note that x -> y, R means read and pop x, and push y, and move to R
- and x, y -> R means read x OR y and do nothing, and move to R

# Recognising Languages
![img_3.png](../images/a4.png)

- Answer: Yes
- The main difference between Deterministic TM and Non-deterministic TM is that for a same tape alphabet in a single state, we can have multiple options.
- So for this example, we can have 0,1 -> R for both edges (this is nondeterministic because at q5 with alphabet 0/1, we have two options).

# Recognising and deciding
![img_4.png](../images/a5.png)

- Answer: No
- Equivalence means recognising the same language, not deciding the same language

![img_5.png](../images/a6.png)

- Answer: B
- Decider means that the TM halts on all inputs

![img_6.png](../images/a7.png)

- Answer: B
- A: false because we have to create new rules for the subset of the language, and this might not be always possible.
- B: true because for a TM M, we can create M' that accepts every input that M accepts and loops on every input that M rejects or loops.
- C: A can loop on some inputs, so A can be recognisable but not decidable.
- D: L(M) is recognisable because it literally means the language that TM M recognises.

![img_8.png](../images/a9.png)

- Answer: Yes
- If L^c is context free, then L^c is decidable
- Decidable languages are closed under complement, so L is decidable
- All decidable languages are recognisable

![img_9.png](../images/a10.png)

- Answer: No
- The complement of a recognisable language is the rejecting or looping strings
- Looping strings are not decidable

![img_10.png](../images/a11.png)

- Answer: No
- A CFG can be an infinite set
- Checking the membership of an infinite set can never be decidable.

![img_7.png](../images/a8.png)

- Answer: No
- Consider a TM A that recognises all finite strings. To decide L(A), we need to check if the string is finite. If it is, then accept, and if it isn't reject.
- But how can we decide if a string is infinite? We can't because it will go on forever. So it is never decided.
