# 0. Learning Objectives
Positioning Computational Intelligence(CI) as a field in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- How to define AI
- How to define CI as a subclass of AI
- Discussing possible CI techniques

# 1. AI?
## Defining AI
- the science and engineering of making *intelligent machines*
- make machines do things that would *require intelligence*
- AI attempts to *understand intelligent* entities

## Approaches to AI

# 2. CI?
- Biologically inspired
  - It does not mean that we want to develop systems that are "identical" to its inspiration
  - Usually the algorithm are extremely simplified version of the biological system or concept
- Focus on model output (behaviour / solution)
  - CI focuses on achieving solutions to problems
  - It is not about replicating inner mechanisms
  - For example, it is not about precisely describing how brain works, but to use a simplified model to solve a problem
