# Learning Objectives
By the end of this week:
- Understand swarm intelligence as a form of distributed optimisation
- Explain the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithm
- Apply ACO to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Explain the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm
- Apply PSO to an optimisation problem


# Swarm Intelligence
"The whole is more important than the sum of the parts."

Computational swarm intelligence:
- Algorithms that define simple individual behaviour modulated by simple interactions between individuals
- Emergent group behaviour

Focus on the individual actors, not on the whole system (which might be too complex to model)

We will focus on two methods:
- Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)
  - Usually used for combinatorial optimisation
  - such as routing
- Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)
  - Usually used for continuous optimisation
  - such as control


# Ant Colony Optimisation
Artificial ants solve optimisation problems, inspired by how real ants communicate (indirectly) via pheromone

Consider finding the shortest path to a goal.

![img_6.png](../images/iiimg_6.png)

We start with all the links having the equal probabilities to be chosen.<br>
The shorter the distance, the more pheromone is released on the link.

![img_7.png](../images/iiimg_7.png)

Assuming Q = 100,

![img_8.png](../images/iiimg_8.png)

Then the probabilities to choose the path are updated according to the amount of pheromone.

![img_9.png](../images/iiimg_9.png)

The probabilities get updated with more iterations (as more ants travel through them and leave more pheromones).

## TSP problem using ACO
Employ artificial ants to solve TSP

We have the following assumptions:
- ants have some memory and remember which cities are visited already
- ants know which path leads to which city
- time is discrete
- starting points are randomly assigned

### Algorithm
1. The initial graph is drawn with the time taken for each path and the initial amount of pheromone on each of the edges (represented by the blue 1's).
   - ![img_10.png](../images/iiimg_10.png)
2. Ants travel through the edges, visiting each city once and coming back to the initial city. The total time (or length) of travel is calculated.
   - ![img_13.png](../images/iiimg_13.png)
3. Shorter route gets more pheromone
   - ![img_11.png](../images/iiimg_11.png)
4. Add this value (can be rounded) to each of the edges that are taken for this travel instance.
   - ![img_14.png](../images/iiimg_14.png)
   - Problems:
     - What if many routes use a link which is not part of a shorter tour?
     - What if a short route contains a very long link that initially is less likely to be used?
5. Use evaporation constant
   - ![img_12.png](../images/iiimg_12.png)
   - The amount of pheromone currently on path ij corresponds to the amount of pheromone existing on it, decreased by a quantity proportional to the evaporation constant, plus the sum of all the pheromone released on that link by all the ants that passed by it this round.
   - ![img_15.png](../images/iiimg_15.png)
6. The probability of choosing for a (previously unseen) path is proportional to the amount of pheromone and inversely proportional to the length of the path
   - ![img_16.png](../images/iiimg_16.png)
     - α, β = predefined hyperparameters (trail x visibility)
     - τij(t) = pheromone on path ij
     - ηij = heuristic, e.g. Euclidean distance
       - ![img_17.png](../images/iiimg_17.png)
     - Σ(m ε c_i^k) τim(t) * ηim = sum of (the product between [pheromone on all paths departing from city i] and [the heuristic])
   - Assuming α = 1, β = 0.5: <br>![img_18.png](../images/iiimg_18.png)
   - ![img_19.png](../images/iiimg_19.png)
7. Update the pheromones
   - ![img_20.png](../images/iiimg_20.png)

With more iterations, shorter routes are found.<br>
Even if a long link (which is not good for a short routes) is very popular, at the end it will be neglected because of evaporation.
Same for long links that are part of a short route

This algorithm finds a short path, but not necessarily the shortest.

### Parameters
Parameters must be tuned to the specific problem
- Number of ants
  - typically same as the number of cities
- Initial distribution of ants over cities
- Q value
  - large enough to not lose precision during updates
- α and β values
- Evaporation rate

### Summary

## ACO - other applications
- Scheduling
  - Assembly lines
  - Airline crew scheduling
- Routing
  - Vehicle routing
  - Circuit boards
- Image processing
  - Edge detection and edge linking
- Network design
  - Energy, gas, internet
- Biology
  - Protein folding

## Comparison between ACO and other algorithms
Dijkstra usually requires less computational power

ACO is usually better suited than Dijkstra for:
- Scenarios where you have a dynamic cost function (such as traffic in a city)
- Very large scenarios

## ACO summary
- A big advantage of ACO is its inherent flexibility
- Environment and conditions might be unknown and/or dynamic (changing over time)
  - Internet: nodes break down
  - Highway: closed for accident
- Ant keep exploring: they adapt fast
- Pheromone gives backup options
  - If a link is closed, the second shortest route is easy to reconstruct
