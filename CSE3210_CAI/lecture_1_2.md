# Coactive Design

---

L.O
- Shakeup your views on autonomy
- Presenting the coactive design method (designing for interdependence) to enable autonomy to reach its potential.

## 1. Autonomy
Autonomous systems are NOT autonomous
- Autonomous systems require interdependency with humans to reach practical goals
  - UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicle)
  - Robot arms in production lines
  - Unmanned spaceships

Points about autonomy
- Autonomy != replacement
- It is not just about task allocation but also about system integration
- The goal should not be working independently but interdependently
- Interdependence has important implications that permeate all design elements (including algorithms and interfaces)

## 2. Interdependence
> Interdependence describes the set of *complementary relationships* that
> two or more parties rely on to manage required or opportunisitic dependencies in joint activity

Interdependence is not limited to compensating for some missing ability or hard constraints, <br>
but also involves normal supportive behaviour associated with teamwork or soft constraints

## 3. Coactive design
> Coactive design is about designing human-AI systems that support interdependence. <Br>
> Designing for interdependence enables autonomy to reach its potential.
