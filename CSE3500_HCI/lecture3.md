### Informed Consent (IC)
- The responsible researcher come to an agreement with their participants about
    - what they will do for their research and
    - what the researcher will do, both legally and ethically, to ensure their physical, emotional, and reputational security
- Includes:
    - opening statement or participant information including:
        - purpose of the research
        - what participants will do
        - what kind of risks - including of identification - are involved
        - what steps you will be taking to mitigate against those risks
- A good practice determines that IC forms should be granular, providing separate consent points as separate tick boxes
